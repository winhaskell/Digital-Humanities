Digital humanities are an interdisciplinary set of fields that are primarily concerned with using digital technologies, 
sources and methods as part of research in the humanities. These fields are heavily involved with using electronic information 
and computational methods to investigate, analyse, synthesise and present research. Digital humanities also aim to explore how 
electronic media affects research in the discipline and likewise how humanities research contributes to computer studies. 
This is a rapidly emerging area of research, encompassing a wide range of methods and practices, which you can explore in this guide.
