Digital Humanities

Digital Humanities (DH) sit at the crossroads of computer science and the humanities. 
Since the early time of computing, a wide range of computational tools have enabled humanities scholars 
to conduct research at a scale once thought impossible. Digital humanities foster collaboration and 
traverse disciplines and methodological orientations. This research field employs technology in pursuing
humanities research and subjects technology to humanistic questioning, often simultaneously.
